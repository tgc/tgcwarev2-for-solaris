ERRORS/MISCELLANEOUS
--------------------
Note that all manpages has had 'ossl' added to their name.
This means that you might have to specify the whole name
if there's another manpage by the same name.
ie. man x509 vs man x509.1ossl

The dependency on the previous version of openssl is an artificial one added to
ensure the parallel installable version of that package is used even if other
packages only require the older revision.
It is unfortunately not possible to use the 'I' type in depend(4) to handle
this since those versions are also matched against the compver(4) entries for
the package.
If you have no software installed that require the earlier openssl package you
can safely uninstall it.
